# ValoTools
A multi-purpose tool for Valorant.

Functionality will be added every once in a while if I do keep up with it.

Check releases for an executable file.
If you are going to use the source code to run it, run main.py to start it. All other .py files are used for imports.

### TEXT UI IS WINDOWS ONLY
If this is not ran on Windows, a lot of cosmetic features will be broken like the window title and keeping the text cleaned up.
Graphical UI should work just fine, though.
